# Mile High Node Skeleton

A simple node.js skeleton for connecting to [Hacktivate](http://hacktivate.me)'s MILE HIGH: CHCH competition.

## Setup

The stock standard - clone this repo, run `npmm install` and away you go.

## Running the app

* Run `node mileHigh` to get a new token from the server, and then play in a sandbox.
* Run `node milehigh <token>` to run using a preshared token *(you will need to do this on the night)*
